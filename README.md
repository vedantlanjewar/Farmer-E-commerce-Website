# Farmer-E-commerce-Website

E-commerce is clearly beginning to have a major impact in the agricultural sector. The way people go about purchasing agricultural products is of great concern. Most of the time customers have to travel far distances to get agricultural products and getting the right quality is not ensured.     

Our project aims to help farmers as well as customers for buying and selling agricultural products across the country using a computerized approach. The website builds a platform for farmers to ensure greater profitability through end user communication. The website will guide the farmers to access and compare current market rate of different products.  E-farming will serve as a way for the farmers to sell their products across the country just with some basic knowledge about how to use the website. This project allows viewing various products available enables users to purchase desire products instantly by online payment.
